Currently I am working as a Ph.D. researcher at UC Irvine with Prof. <a href='https://hyoukjunkwon.com/'>Hyoukjun Kwon</a>. My research interests include domain-specific computer architectures, hardware acceleration of ML workloads, hardware aware machine learning. I am passionate about designing deep learning solutions to challenging problems and deploying them to low-power devices.

Previously, I worked as an Embedded AI Research Engineer at <a href='https://www.deeplite.ai/'>Deeplite</a> in Toronto. There I primarily worked with compilers and runtimes to deploy Deep Learning vision models in low-power embedded devices. I have completed my Master of Science in Communication Engineering with a focus on hardware acceleration for inference at the <a href='https://www.tum.de/en/'>Technical University of Munich</a> under Prof. <a href='https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lis/persons/management/walter-stechele/'>Walter Stechele</a>. Earlier, I spent time with <a href='https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/homepage.html'>Intel</a> working on Digital Design Verification and System Debugger tools validation.

 Besides spending time in front of a screen or tweaking hardware, I am fond of hiking, biking and do occasional landscape <a href='https://www.instagram.com/saptarshi_mrse7en/'>photography</a>. Having "well trained" taste buds I am picking up with culinary skills. Here is a link to my outdated <a href='https://sapmitra.github.io/old_website/'>website</a>.
